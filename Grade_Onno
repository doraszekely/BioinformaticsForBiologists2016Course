The grade I deserve should be a 7.5.
I looked at what the others did and compared to them I did a bit less I guess. 

This is what I did:
  -Set up a nice account with profile picture
  -Create a repository
  -Allowed DÃ³ra and Javier to become collaborators
  -Pushed files in my repository
  -Accepted a pull request from Javier
  -Made an issue to become accepted as a collaborator in the ColdFusionReactor repository
  -Gave you feedback on your lecture
  -And some other stuff I probably forgot to mention

Thanks for being so enthousiastic!
