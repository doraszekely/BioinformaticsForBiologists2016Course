I can't aim very high because I was very tired to concentrate but I did my best I think so I could go for at least a 7..?
things I did:
created an account with a nice profile picture
created a repository to play with and also a rep for my personal project
	I managed to add some pictures to my personal project's readme
	using this: ![Alt text](/relative/path/to/img.jpg?raw=true "Optional Title")
	I googled it so the credit is not entirely mine
followed some people
I asked to contribute in some repositories
I did some pull requests also
I repeatedly used cloning/pulling, staging, commiting and pushing
