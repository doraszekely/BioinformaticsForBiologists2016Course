# Jurjan van der Zee

The grade I think I deserve doesn't really matter, because I won't get a grade for taking 
the course :). But let's make it an 8 just for the sake of it.

- I managed to dust of my old GitHub account
- I configured GitHub
- I helped two other people with GitHub
- I've created two repositories. One was my test repository, which I deleted to try out 
how to delete repositories. I will use the second one for my own project next week.
- I became a collaborator on the 'BioinformaticsForBiologistsCourse2016' repository 
and pushed a text file named 'LastCommentWins.txt' intended for collaborating on the 
repository. So far, one other person as appended to it.
- I forked the 'BioinformaticsForBiologistsCourse2016' repository and removed the 
'LastCommentWins.txt' which I previously added. Then, I sent a pull request for the change
I made.
- In addition, I approved a pull request Miranka made to the original 'BioinformaticsForBiologistsCourse2016'
repository and rejected one Tjibbe made because of a merge conflict.
